You said why I'm holding on baby, ohh
I will never back down
Are you walking out of my life
Saying you really don't love me, ohh
Baby you don't mean that
You remember all the we had
I took it for granted that you love me the same
But I gotta keep on talkin'
Listen to my heartbeat-beat-beat
Saying do you love me me me
But I'm lying here alone
So I put you in a song beside my heartbeat-beat-beat
I know I haven't been the best lately,ohh
And I really know now
I should give you all of my time,yeah
You really do deserve better,ohh
Gotta get you somehow
Can we start over again now
I took it for granted that you love me the same but I
Gotta keep on talking
Listen to my heartbeat-beat-beat
Saying do you love me me me
But I'm lying here alone
So I put you in a song
Beside my heartbeat-beat-beat
Why I'm holding on baby
I will never back down
Are you walking out of my life
So listen to my heartbeat-beat-beat
Saying do you love me
And you saying that love me
But I'm lying here alone
So I put you in a song beside my heartbeat-beat-beat
Saying do you love me me me
But I'm lying here alone
So I put you in a song beside my heartbeat-beat-beat
